# BMI Functional Programming Example

## Apology
My purpose here is to noodle around with a functional approach to solving a personal problem.

You see, I lost 100 pounds some years back, and one of the things that made me aware of was that I was obese. Once I owned this fact I could take steps to fix it. And quantitatively measure my progress toward non-obesity. And eventually non-overweight.

BMI is measured in metric units and my scale and yardstick are in Imperial units. So, the notion of units conversion combined with the steps of the actual BMI calculation are good candidates for function composition.

Most educational examples are contrived. So is this one.

## Things unfinished

### F# Implementation & Tests
But it let me get some exercise in the approach. And since I wanted to get better at xUnit, there's that, too.

You'll note that I didn't bother to test the F# equivalents. Uh, because I haven't written the F# solution yet...

### Multiple Platforms
At the moment .NET Core (or whatever .NET 7.0.0 calls itself) is running on MacOS, Linux, and another operating system made by the people who abandoned Xenix back in the '80s. So, after I check this project into Github I hope to copy it to my other computers and get it running there.

I wonder how one does a project that runs on both WSL and its host OS... 

So much to learn.
